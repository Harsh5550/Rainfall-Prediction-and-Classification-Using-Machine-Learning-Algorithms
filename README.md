# Rainfall Prediction and Classification Using Machine Learning Algorithms

Introduction:
This project focuses on analyzing a rainfall dataset obtained from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology. The objective is to apply various classification algorithms to the data, assess their performance, and predict rainfall patterns accurately. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to build models that can effectively classify rainfall occurrences based on relevant features in the dataset.

Data Collection:
The rainfall dataset used in this project was obtained from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology. It provides historical records of rainfall measurements at various locations. Alternatively, the data can be downloaded from [insert link to dataset].

Methodology:

Data Cleaning: The raw dataset was processed to remove any inconsistencies, missing values, or outliers that may affect the accuracy of the models.

Feature Selection: Relevant features were identified and selected based on their impact on rainfall prediction. These features serve as inputs to the classification algorithms.

Classification Algorithms: The following machine learning algorithms were implemented and evaluated:
a. Linear Regression
b. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
c. Decision Trees
d. Logistic Regression
e. Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Model Evaluation: The performance of each classifier was assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics, including accuracy score, Jaccard index, F1-score, log loss, mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R2-score. These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and reliability of the models.

Results:
The classification models were trained and evaluated using the rainfall dataset. The accuracy scores, Jaccard indices, F1-scores, log loss, mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R2-scores were calculated for each classifier. These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of the models' performance in predicting rainfall patterns.

Conclusion:
Through this project, we successfully implemented and evaluated various classification algorithms for rainfall prediction using the provided dataset. The results obtained from the models' performance metrics shed light on their accuracy and effectiveness in classifying rainfall occurrences. The findings of this project contribute to the understanding of machine learning techniques in rainfall prediction and provide valuable insights for future weather forecasting applications.
